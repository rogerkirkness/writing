We recently fundraised in Silicon Valley. Here are some of the questions we got:

* What were you doing before this?  
* Where did you go to school?  
* Which one of you owns the number?  
* Who is handling sales? Tech?  
* Do you have any gaps you need fill ASAP?  
* How big is the team today?  
* What's your current MCV/MRR/ARR?
* How'd you learn about the problem?  
* How far along are you?  
* Do you have a sense of the US market size?
* How much do you need to get to Series A metrics?  
* What's your demo day goal?  
* I heard Z passed, what's the reason?  
* I heard A is interested, can you comment?  
* Who are the top companies in the batch?  
* I think X is working on the same thing (?)  
* What are the terms?  
* How much are you raising?  
* Why fundraise now?  
* Who are your biggest competitors?  
* What could you do with 10 sales reps?  
* Can we see a demo?  
* Do you have a lead investor?  
* Can I have your Stripe API key to run through my analytics?
* Which one scares you the most?  
* What do you have on them?
